# blinkit_analysis_mysql
This project is all about digging into Blinkit’s open-source dataset to uncover real business insights and key performance indicators (KPIs). I loaded the raw data into MySQL, cleaned it up, explored the relationships, and then used Power BI to build visuals that actually make sense for decision-making.

# Main objective
Break down Blinkit’s operational and business performance by:

1.Importing and structuring the dataset in MySQL
2.Running queries to analyse growth, efficiency, and customer behaviour
3.Building interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualise trends and KPIs

# Tech Stack
MySQL – for data cleaning, modeling, and analysis
Power BI – for dashboards and visual storytelling
GitHub – version control + project documentation

# Loading the database
I imported the Blinkit dataset into MySQL and performed:
Data cleaning
Schema design
Exploratory SQL queries
KPI calculations
This helped set a solid foundation before moving everything to Power BI.
